#### About
Hello, I'm Manar! I studied Accounting at the Faculty of Commerce,and I also completed Data Analysis studies through the Digital Egypt Pioneers initiative and I've developed a passion for applying my analytical skills in the field of data analysis. Throughout my studies, I honed my ability to work with numbers and analyze financial data, which I believe will be a valuable asset in data analysis.

I am currently working on enhancing my skills in using technical tools like [Python, SQL, Excel, Powerbi] to dive deeper into data analysis. I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and improve my skills in this field, and I look forward to using data to solve problems and generate actionable insights


### Education
Commerce, Ainshams University

### Projects
- Data Cleaning and Validation Project
- code: Data Cleaning and Validation Project

In this project, I cleaned a financial dataset to ensure its quality and accuracy. The steps I performed are:
Data Profiling: Generated summary statistics for the TransactionAmount column to identify anomalies or outliers.
Comparison with Original Data: Compared the number of rows in both the original and cleaned datasets to ensure no rows were lost.
Validation Rules: Ensured all email addresses contained "@" and that the financial values were not negative or incorrect. Missing data was appropriately handled.
Consistency Checks: Checked for and removed any duplicate TransactionID entries with the same transaction date.
Cross-Table Validation: Used SQL to verify that each transaction had a valid customer reference in the customer_profiles table.
Null Value Check: Wrote queries to ensure there were no NULL values in the dataset.
Impact of Cleaning: Created a report comparing the original and cleaned datasets, showing improvements in reducing missing values and duplicates.
Tools Used: SQL
Challenges: One challenge was ensuring no important data was lost during cleaning.
Outcome: The data was improved and made ready for analysis.
